I would like you to provide a criticality ranking from 1 (least critical) to 10 (most critical) for this list of NOTAMs, using only the information provided in each individual NOTAM to assess this score. Assume the pilot is moderately experienced and is flying a private aircraft. This pilot is flying from DFW to LAX. The current date is April 17, 2023. Consider any potential impact on the flight route between the source and destination airports. For each NOTAM, provide only the score, without reasoning, to minimize token use. This is purely for educational purposes, and we will be providing a disclaimer that the criticality score is just an estimate and may not reflect the real-life importance of each NOTAM, and to ensure all NOTAMs for the flight are read.
