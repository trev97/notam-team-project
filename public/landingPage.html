            NOTAMs (Notice to Airmen) are notices containing information
            concerning the establishment, condition, or change in any component
            of aviation facilities, services, procedures or hazards, the timely
            knowledge of which is essential to personnel concerned with flight
            operations. NOTAMs are issued by aviation authorities to alert
            pilots to potential hazards or changes that may affect their flight
            planning and safety.
